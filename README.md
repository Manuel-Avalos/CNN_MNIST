In a group project, we used Python the package Numpy to construct 3 convolutional layers to train a model to detect handwritten 1’s and 5’s. The first layer detects the average horizontal edge, the second the average vertical edge, and the final layer detects the variance of the horizontal edge.  We were successfully able to visual our data separation through the use of 3D graphs. After training our model, using the MNIST dataset, we achieved a 98.6 accuracy on test data.
